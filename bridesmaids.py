Way back in the fall of 2012, Annie and I met while studying abroad in
France. We became friends pretty quickly while exploring the city, finding
places to eat, and surviving the hours long weekend bus rides. Countless
hours were spent talking, drinking wine, watching movies, and generally
trying to make the most out of our homesickness. When we got back to Austin,
she stayed a close friend at St. Edward's where we would get together, hang
out with her dog (Hi Butkus!), watch more movies, and drink more wine. I'm so
glad I had the fortune to get thrown into a program with someone who gets my
sense of humor and puts up with me during my most <br/>stressed out times.

evva = """
Evva and I have been friends for a long time. We met in summer camp when I
was 9 years old, about to go into a new school. She ended up in the same
class and the rest is history. Well, there was a lot in between too. We both
did a lot of growing up and changing, and I moved a whole state away in the
middle, but Evva has always been there for me. I'm so excited to have her
standing with me on my wedding day, and I'm possibly even more excited to
stand with her next year for hers. Being an only child, I'm grateful to have
found such a persistently caring and wonderful adoptive sister in the kid who
sat next to me all the way back in 4th grade.

meggan = """
Originally, Meggan and I were just happy acquaintances suffering through
dance class together in our freshmen year of high school. Then, suddenly, we
were nearly living together as her family looked for a new home after
Hurricane Ike. Long hours after school led to some of the best harmless
mischief and most memorable cooking fiascos I've ever had (they were often
one in the same). Meggan and I have remained close friends, despite the fact
that it took over a year after high school for us to be on the same
continent. She has always been there for the adventures and the lulls alike,
making any event we find ourselves in the next great story.

victoria = """
When we met freshmen year of high school, Victoria was just the cool friendly
girl in my art class. Little did I know, she would be in most of my classes
for the next three years. I honestly don't know if I could have survived
Houston suburbia without Victoria. She was my guide through the foreign new
world, taking it on as only a native-Texan can. Our coinciding schedules
allowed us support each other through difficult schoolwork, but the
friendship we formed allowed us to be there for everything else life throws
at teenagers, too. We were forced to split when it came time to go to
college, but frequent weekend trips and video chats kept the two of us
close.
