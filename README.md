# My Wedding Website

This is just a simple Flask website I am building for my wedding in June 2016.


If you'd like to see what my wedding website looked like when it was live, simply clone this repo, ensure that you have Python 3.x along with Flask installed, and type ```python app.py``` into your terminal!
