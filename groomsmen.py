adam = """ My little brother, my corpsmate, and (finally) my friend.
For those of you out there who don't know Adam very well, or haven't yet had
the chance to meet him at all, trust me when I say that you are in for a very
special treat come Reception time. Adam and I go back all the way to '94, and
even though I'm certain that I could have been a much more understanding and
sharing big brother for most of that time, Adam's been with my through it
all. """

kyle = """ KG and I may only go back to 2009, but in that time he's become
one of my best, and most dependable friends. I honestly can't remember the
first things either of us said to one another, all the way back on the
Wyoming State Fair Grounds parking lot some typical wyoming day, but I do
know that these days I can't imagine what all those air-mattress forts I made
would've looked like without him.  """

mark = """ Not counting drum corps (you might be sensing a trend here), Mark
is the only other groom's man to have lived with me other than Adam. Luckily
for me, Mark wasn't sick of me after 3 long summer seasons, and offered to
help save me from an hour and a half long commute to South Austin every day
when the other room in his apartment opened up mid-year. It's been a hell of
a rollercoaster since then, but I'm glad that our friendship hasn't
wavered. """

wes = """ Wes and I first met in between turns pantomiming trains during the
summer of 2008. It's a testament to our friendship that even after that
ridiculous, arm-breaking trainride of a summer Wes still managed to put up
with me happily for two additional years. As one of my closest friends during
my time on tour, Wes has had some unique insights into me as a person - after
all that I'm glad he's still making the trip for the wedding. """

explainer = """ There isn't going to be a Maid of Honor or a Best Man! We
know that this might sound cliche, but everyone you've just read about holds
a truly unique place in lives of both of us. We agonized for weeks over who
we could honor with those titles, never settling on a definitive answer.
Eventually, we realized that above all this day exists to celebrate our lives
together with those closest to us and that we couldn't possibly choose to
single out any of our friends over the others in good conscience. So, like a
bunch of other facets of our wedding, this is just going to be another thing
where we don't quite stick to tradition. """
