adam = """
My little brother, my corpsmate, and (finally) my friend. For those of you
out there who don't know Adam very well, or haven't yet had the chance to
meet him at all, trust me when I say that you are in for a very special treat
come Reception time. Adam and I go back all the way to '94, and I think it's
fitting that as he starts his journey into the jungle that is life after
college he'll be helping me start my journey into the jungle that is
marriage. At the end of the day, even though I'm certain that I could have
been a much more understanding and sharing big brother for most of that time,
Adam's been with me through it all.
"""

kyle = """
KG and I may only go back to 2009, but in that time he's easily become one of
my best and most dependable friends. Honestly, I can't remember the first
things either of us said to one another, all the way back on the Wyoming
State Fair Grounds parking lot some typical Wyoming day. I don't even
remember how, exactly, Kyle became such a constant presence throughout my
time on tour so quickly. What I do know for sure is that these days I can't
imagine what all those air-mattress forts I made would've looked like without
him.
"""

mark = """
Not counting drum corps (you might be sensing a trend here), Mark
is the only other groom's man to have lived with me other than Adam. Luckily
for me, Mark wasn't sick of me after 3 long summer seasons, and offered to
help save me from an hour and a half long commute to South Austin every day
when the other room in his apartment opened up mid-year. Even luckier for
me, a year and a half of being roommates didn't manage to drive him up too
many walls either. It's definitely been a hell of a rollercoaster since then,
but I'm glad that our <br/>friendship hasn't wavered.
"""

wes = """
Wes and I first met in between turns pantomiming trains during the
summer of 2008. It's a testament to our friendship that even after that
ridiculous, arm-breaking train-ride of a summer Wes still managed to not only
put up with me for the next two years, but to even be my seat partner for his
last summer in the corps. As one of my closest friends during my time on
tour, Wes has had some unique insights into me as a person - after all that
I couldn't be happier that he'll be making the trip for the wedding (even
though he has by far the quickest trip!).
