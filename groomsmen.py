adam = """ Adam. My little brother, my corpsmate, and (finally) my friend.
For those of you out there who don't know Adam very well, or haven't yet had
the chance to meet him at all, trust me when I say that you are in for a very
special treat come Reception time. Adam and I go back all the way to '94, and
even though I'm certain that I could have been a much more understanding and
sharing big brother for most of that time, Adam's been with my through it; I
couldn't be happier to have him with me on what's definitely going to be the
biggest day of my life so far. """

kyle = """ KG and I may only go back to 2009, but in that time he's become
one of my best, and most dependable friends. I honestly can't remember the
first things either of us said to one another, all the way back on the
Wyoming State Fair Grounds parking lot some typical wyoming day, but I do
know that these days I can't imagine what all those air-mattress forts I made
would've looked like without him. Without the annual call of drum corps, it
has been far too long since we've gotten to hang out, and I couldn't be
happier to break that streak with my wedding (at the latest!).  """

mark = """ Not counting drum corps (you might be sensing a trend here), mark
is the only other groom's man to have lived with me other than Adam. Luckily
for me, Mark wasn't sick of me after 3 long summer seasons, and offered to
help save me from an hour and a half long commute to South Austin every day
when the other room in his apartment opened up mid-year. A crazy year and a
half of courses, parties, road trips, and even a degree followed after that.
And even though he probably had at least a million super valid reasons to
regret that initial decision to let me become his roommate, I'm so glad that
he'll be helping me out again this June. """
