Well, dear guests, it's actually a pretty funny story. It starts all the way
back in 2011, when both Patton and Kirby were starting their first semesters
at St. Edward's University. You might not know it by looking at her, but back
then Patton was a Computer Science major - just like Kirby. (Don't worry, that
phase doesn't last very long.) Kirby ended up asking Patton for some help in
the class they shared together that first semeseter, although to be honest
things didn't really get off the ground until their second semester, that
next spring. You see, right before Patton switched away from CS and into her
eventual International Relations major, she and Kirby had a full three classes
together that semester; and even though that arrangement didn't last more than
a couple of weeks, Kirby figured that it had to be some kind of God given sign
that he ought to give this girl at least a chance to stand him up on a date
or two.
"""

paragraph_two = """
Skipping a little bit ahead, it looked like Kirby might've been right. On the
drive home from their second date, Kirby told Patton how he'd been having a
great time seeing her, and wouldn't it be cool if the two of them could spend
more time together during the next week - their Spring Break. "Well," she
replied, "we should talk first." Kirby's face immediately fell, but much to
his surprise, Patton continued to tell him that she wasn't breaking up with
him so soon, she was just already committed to a trip to Japan over spring
break through a class. And that, oh - by the way, she would also be spending
the next semester abroad in France. It wasn't that she didn't like Kirby - not
at all - she just wanted him to know what he was getting himself into before
things got international.
"""

paragraph_three = """
Little did either of them know that over the next four years they would end up
spending over a year away from each other for one reason or another, from
study abroad programs to federal research 'experiences' and even graduate
school. They did however, find a wealth of amazing time together, including a
magical five month stay in Prague where they were lucky enough to visit 14
different countries in Europe (if you include the Vatican as a separate
country). By the end of their time together at St. Edward's, when Kirby
graduated and moved up to Boston for his first year in grad school, he had
realized that he couldn't imagine his life without Patton, and shortly after
moving to Beantown he saved up and bought a ring. And even though the weather
wasn't amazing, and the highest point in Austin could certainly have been more
scenic than it was, Kirby got down on one knee on a December morning during
his first break from grad school, and thanked God that Patton simply said
"Yes".
"""

paragraph_four = """
A little less than eight months after that, when Patton and Kirby were
spending the summer of 2015 in Boston before Patton started her graduate
studies, they decided that they'd really rather stop spending over
a quarter of their time as a couple thousands of miles apart, although they
had gotten quite good at it by then. And so, Kirby engaged in negotiations
with his job, and they packed up and moved here, to Chicago, together -
finally starting a new chapter of their lives together after nearly four
years. And that, dear guests, is why they have invited all of you up to this
Windy City this June. So that rather than dealing with yet another major life
event from miles and miles away, they could bring all of you to them, in the
first city that's ever truly been theirs, to celebrate the end of their
separate travels and the beginning of a beautiful, astonishing, and
incredibly strong marriage.
